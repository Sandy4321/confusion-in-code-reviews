# Gold Standard Set of Confusion Code Review Comments and Confusion Coding Scheme

 this folder contains the two gold standard sets with general and inline comments from Android labeled as *confusion* and *no confusion*.
 
This folder provides two gold standard datasets with the confusion annotation for the code review comments from Android labeled as *confusion* and *no confusion*, and also the complete list of features of our confusion coding scheme. This dataset was partially published at ICSME'2017 in the paper **[Confusion Detection in Code Reviews](https://felipeebert.github.io/publications/icsme2017.pdf)**.
