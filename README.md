- [dataset-confusion-code-reviews](https://github.com/felipeebert/confusion-code-reviews/tree/master/dataset-confusion-code-reviews) - this folder contains the two gold standard sets with general and inline comments from Android labeled as *confusion* and *no confusion*. This dataset was partially published at ICSME'2017 in the paper **[Confusion Detection in Code Reviews](https://felipeebert.github.io/publications/icsme2017.pdf)**.

- [dataset-confusion-in-context](https://github.com/felipeebert/confusion-code-reviews/tree/master/dataset-confusion-in-context) - this folder contains the gold standard set with the *confusion in context* with the reasons for confusion in code reviews, its impacts, and the strategies developers use to cope with confusion. This dataset was published at SANER'2019 in the paper **[Confusion in Code Reviews: Reasons, Impacts and Coping Strategies](https://felipeebert.github.io/publications/saner2019.pdf)**.

- [dataset-questions-intentions](https://github.com/felipeebert/confusion-code-reviews/tree/master/dataset-questions-intentions) - this folder contains the gold standard set with the communicative intentions of developers questions in code reviews. This dataset was published at ICSME'2018 in the paper **[Communicative Intention in Code Review Questions](https://felipeebert.github.io/publications/icsme2018.pdf)**.

- [confusion-detection](https://github.com/felipeebert/confusion-code-reviews/tree/master/confusion-detection) - this folder contains the replication package of the confusion identification studies and the classification models.
